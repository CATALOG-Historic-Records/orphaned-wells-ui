The Custom Processors page is used to create the Splitter, Classifier,
and Extractor Processors of the OGRRE Workflow. Clicking on "Create
Processor" will open a right side panel used to name the new processor
(Cannot be changed later), When "Create" is pressed the new processor is
created and opened.
