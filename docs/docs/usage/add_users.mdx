# Overview

OGRRE is locked down to authorized users only. This means that if you want a new user, you have to add them to your database. Assuming you have one user with the proper permissions, adding users and updating roles is easy through the user interface.

## Add New User to OGRRE

<AddUser/>

## Update user role

<UpdateRole/>
